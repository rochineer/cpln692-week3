    # Lab 1, Part 4 â€” Stretch Goal: Project Euler

    ## Introduction

    Practice your Javascript and math skills by solving a problem on Project
    Euler. Project Euler is a series of challenging math and computer science
    problems that can be solved using any language (for our class, use
    Javascript).

    Solve the first problem on this page https://projecteuler.net/archives
    (Multiples of 3 and 5). To check your answer, create an account and you will
    be able to submit your final result.

    If you complete problem 1, move on to problem 2!
    problem 1:
    If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
    Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
    problem 2:
    Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
    1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
    By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

    ===================== */

    var sum = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
      if (i%3 == 0 || i%5 == 0) sum = sum + i;
    }


    var sumEven = 0;
    var ArrayFib = [1,2];

    while (ArrayFib[ArrayFib.length - 1]<4000000) {
      ArrayFib.push(ArrayFib[ArrayFib.length-1]+ArrayFib[ArrayFib.length-2]);
      console.log (ArrayFib.length);
    }

    ArrayFib.forEach (obj => {
      if (obj % 2 === 0) sumEven = sumEven + obj;
      console.log (sumEven);
    })
